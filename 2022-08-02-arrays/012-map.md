# All About Arrays - Map

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const myArrayDoubled = myArray.map(item => item * 2);
```

## flat and flatMap

Imagine we had this data:

```javascript
const players = [
  { name: 'Alex', items: ['Sword', 'Shield' ]},
  { name: 'Adam', items: ['Apple', 'Potion' ]}
];
```

and I wanted to get an array of all of the items. I can use map to get an array of the arrays of items:

```javascript
const items = players.map(player => player.items);
```

but the result is not that convenient:

```javascript
[['Sword', 'Shield'], ['Apple', 'Potion']]
```

I just want a flat array and not this nested one. I can do that using `flat`:

```javascript
const items = players.map(player => player.items).flat();
```

and now we have

```javascript
['Sword', 'Shield', 'Apple', 'Potion']
```

But I can actually use the handy `flatMap` function to get this all in one go!

```javascript
const items = players.flatMap(player => player.items);
```

## Chaining

You can chain other array functions to do cool stuff. A nice shorthand trick to filter out falsy values is to use the `Boolean` constructor:

```javascript
const myArray = [{ name: 'Alex' }, { name: 'Sarah' }, { name: 'Adam' }];
const lowercaseAndStartsWithA = myArray.map(person => {
  if (person.name[0] !== 'A') {
    return null;
  }

  return {
    ...person,
    name: person.name.toLowerCase
  };
}).filter(Boolean);
```

This results in:

```javascript
[{ name: 'alex' }, { name: 'adam' }]
```

What's going on here is that `Boolean(something)` will return either `true` or `false` depending on if `something` is truthy or falsy. `null` is falsy so it will be filtered out by `filter`.

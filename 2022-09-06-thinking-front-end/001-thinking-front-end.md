## System Design

Use RADAR (Requirements, Architecture, Data Model, API, The Rest). Can be applied to problems of any size, from whole systems to individual components!

1. Requirements - Understand all the requirements before you start.
2. Architecture - Outline the pieces you're going to build. Draw it!
3. Data Model - What is the data? Where is the data stored? Where will it be passed?
4. API - How will someone/something else consume this?
5. The Rest - ...

### The Rest
